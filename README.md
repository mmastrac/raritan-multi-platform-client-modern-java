# Modernization Script for the Raritan Multi-Platform Client

The Raritan MPC for the older Dominion products (KX II/etc) uses an outdated version of Java that is
incompatible with modern macs. This makes use of a brew-installed Java 11 to run properly on these computers.

## Building

Download the latest MPC for the KX II (mpc-installer.MPC_7.0.3.5.62.jar.zip) and place in the inputs/orig/ folder.

Run `rewrite.sh`
